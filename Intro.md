## The Cache Makers Uno project

I created this board in the hopes of using it to teach a group of kids in the [Cache Makers](cachemakers.org) 4H program. 

The build met with mixed success. The board has a large number of solder points to solder in. The older students with a little more hand eye coordination and practice with soldering did ok, the Younger students struggled quite a bit more. 
The board, when completed does provide a functional Arduino Uno compatible device, with some extras for convenience when playing around beginning arduino programming. 

For the next session, I used the [YourDuino RoboRED](http://yourduino.com/sunshop2/index.php?l=product_detail&p=429) which I am a fan of.
